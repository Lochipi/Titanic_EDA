# Titanic_EDA
This is a in-depth EDA for each column to identify outliers. 
Sure, I can help you write a README file for your Titanic dataset repository. Here's an example:

# Titanic EDA Project

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic passenger dataset. The goal of this project is to analyze the data, draw meaningful insights, and provide visualizations to supplement the analysis.

## Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including their PassengerId, Age, Cabin etc.

## Tools Used
- Python 3.7 and Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization

## Analysis
In this project, I explored the following questions:
- What is the distribution of HomePlanet, CryoSleep and Age among the passengers?
- What is the distribution of HomePlanet rates across different places

I also created visualizations to supplement the analysis, including countplot which I majorly prefer for categorical data.

## Conclusion
Overall, this EDA project revealed several interesting insights about the passengers on the Titanic.

## Files
- `Titanic EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA process and analysis
- `train.csv`: dataset used for the analysis
